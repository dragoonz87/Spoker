# Spoker

Spoker is just poker. But made by me, Sam.

## Plan

* Go backend implementing WebSockets myself based on the [RFC-6455](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.txt) standard

* Basic HTML/CSS/JS frontend using built-in [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) object

* Possible Zig TUI implementing WebSockets (again using the [RFC-6455](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.txt) standard) with all HTTP support coming from me

* Will need to research more about poker rules lol
